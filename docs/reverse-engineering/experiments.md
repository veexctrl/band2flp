## PKG-001 — supplied package inventory

**Question:** What is the outer `.band` container and which logical components are present?

**Fixture:** One supplied GarageBand `.band` project, kept outside this source tree.

**Observation:** Python `zipfile` enumerated nine ZIP members. `projectData` decompresses to an XML plist; output metadata is available in XML and binary plist forms; images are PNGs. The `projectData` ZIP local header was cross-checked through IDA MCP at the member's raw archive offset.

**Result:** ZIP package layout is directly confirmed for this fixture. No claim is made that all `.band` projects contain the same components.

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED for the inspected fixture.

**Next:** Inventory additional projects and compare their member sets and projectData wrappers.

## PD-001 — keyed archive wrapper

**Question:** Is `projectData` a plist and where is the main logic model referenced?

**Observation:** The plist root declares `NSKeyedArchiver`; `$top` includes `DfDocument logic model`; the referenced model has a `DfLogicModelLogicSong` reference; the song object includes `NS.data` (239,274 bytes in the inspected fixture).

**Result:** The wrapper and reference chain are directly visible. The contents and record layout of the `NS.data` bytes remain unknown.

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED for this fixture's serialized object graph; generality across GarageBand versions is untested.

**Next:** Collect controlled note/region fixtures and correlate changes in this payload.

## META-001 — summary metadata keys

**Question:** Which summary fields can be read without decoding the logic payload?

**Observation:** `Output/metadata.plist` contains tempo, signature numerator/denominator, duration, and arrange-track-count fields.

**Result:** The parser reads these named values but does not use the count to fabricate track objects. Duration units need validation against controlled projects.

**Confidence:** HIGH CONFIDENCE for field meaning from explicit names; duration units remain HYPOTHESIS.

**Next:** Compare known tempo/meter/duration projects and validate the values against GarageBand display/export behavior.

## CROSS-001 — output and asset metadata

**Question:** Do the output summary and asset plist expose matching track counts and media placement?

**Observation:** `Output/assetsmetadata.plist` is a binary plist with `NumberOfTracks`, global tempo/meter fields, and resource-list keys including `AudioFiles`, `PlaybackFiles`, and `UnusedAudioFiles`. Its track count differs from `Output/metadata.plist`'s arrange-track count in the inspected fixture. Some resource paths name external content; they are not project package members.

**Result:** The two track-count fields cannot be treated as interchangeable. Resource references are retained as asset metadata but are not interpreted as placed arrangement regions.

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED for the observed distinction in this fixture; intended meanings and generality remain unconfirmed.

**Next:** Compare both counts and asset lists across controlled empty, MIDI-only, and audio-region fixtures.

## BIN-001 — opaque payload markers and resource strings

**Question:** Does the logic-song NSData payload expose repeated candidate record markers or literal resource references?

**Fixture:** The same single supplied project; payload read through IDA Python from the mapped ZIP bytes and then through its `projectData` object graph.

**Observation:** The byte sequence `23 47 C0 AB` occurs at payload offsets 0, 60, and 760. Those occurrences partition the observed payload into spans of 60, 700, and 238,514 bytes. At least one sampler-resource basename from `assetsmetadata.plist` occurs twice as ASCII in the payload. No basename from its `AudioFiles` list was found as a raw ASCII substring.

**Result:** The sequence and string overlaps are observations only. They do not establish record boundaries, reference semantics, or audio placement. In particular, absence of literal basenames does not rule out IDs, indices, or transformed references.

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED for byte/string observations in this fixture; HYPOTHESIS that the repeated sequence is a framing marker.

**Next:** Compare the payload from controlled changes and determine whether marker offsets or nearby values track a known property.
